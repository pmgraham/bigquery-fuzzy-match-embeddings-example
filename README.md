## Step 1: Set Up Your Data

First, you need to have your two customer tables in BigQuery. The provided code starts by creating these tables and inserting some sample data.

`customers_primary`: This is your main or "golden" record list.

`customers_secondary`: This is the second list you want to match against the primary one.

Notice the variations in the data: "Samantha 'Sam' Jones" vs. "Sam Jones", or "456 Sunken Meadow Pkwy" vs. "456 Sunken Meadow Parkway". These are the kinds of inconsistencies we want to overcome.

## Step 2: Create the Embedding Model

Next, you need to tell BigQuery how to create the embeddings. You do this by creating a remote model. This model acts as a bridge between BigQuery and one of Google's powerful Vertex AI text-embedding models.

`CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL`: This command creates the model inside your BigQuery dataset.

`REMOTE WITH CONNECTION`: This specifies the cloud resource connection that allows BigQuery to securely communicate with the Vertex AI service. You'll need to create this connection in your GCP project first.

`OPTIONS ( endpoint = 'text-embedding-005' )`: This tells BigQuery exactly which AI model to use. text-embedding-005 is a recent and powerful model for this task.

## Step 3: Generate Embeddings for Both Tables

Now that you have a model, you can use it to "embed" your customer data. You'll run this process for both of your tables, creating two new tables that contain the original data plus the new embedding vectors.

The key steps in the query are:

  Concatenate Fields: For each customer, combine the relevant text fields (like name, address, and email) into a single string using `CONCAT()`. This gives the model the full context for each customer.
  
  Call the Model: Use the ML.GENERATE_TEXT_EMBEDDING function, passing it the model you created (customer_text_embedder) and the concatenated text data.
  
  Store the Results: The function returns the original data along with the new embedding. You save this output into a new table (e.g., customers_primary_embeddings).

You repeat this process for the customers_secondary table to create customers_secondary_embeddings.

## Step 4: Find the Closest Matches with Vector Search
This is the final and most important step. You now have two tables with embedding vectors. You can use the VECTOR_SEARCH function to compare the vectors in the secondary table against the vectors in the primary table to find the most similar pairs.

`VECTOR_SEARCH(...)`: This is the core function.

Base Table: The first argument is the table you are searching within (customers_primary_embeddings).

Query Table: The third argument is the table with the records you want to find matches for (customers_secondary_embeddings).

text_embedding: You specify the name of the column containing the vectors in both tables.

top_k => 1: This tells the function to return only the single best match for each record.

distance_type => 'COSINE': This specifies the method for calculating similarity. Cosine distance is a standard way to measure how similar two vectors are. A smaller distance means a better match.

`The ROW_NUMBER()` function is used as a safeguard to ensure you truly get only the single best match if there are any ties or complex results.

## Step 5: Final Result
The final result is a clean table showing each record from your secondary list paired with its most likely match from the primary list, successfully overcoming the "fuzzy" differences in the original data.
